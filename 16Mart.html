                       The massacre targeting Istanbul University students 
                       on March 16, 1978, was not a random act of violence but a 
                       pre-planned conspiracy. Days before the incident, intelligence 
                       reports reached the police department warning that "dynamite would be 
                       thrown at leftist students," yet no precautions were taken. On the day 
                       of the attack, the usual police protection was withdrawn under the pretext 
                       of "other duties." Students were forced to exit the university’s main gate 
                       into Beyazıt Square in a group, 
                       making them vulnerable targets.

                    <p class="typewriter">
                        As soon as the students exited,
                        attackers from within right-wing 
                        groups threw American-made TNT bombs—registered in 
                        the NATO inventory—into the crowd while shouting 
                        "Down with communists." Immediately after the explosion, 
                        a volley of gunfire was opened on the defenseless students. 
                        This brutal attack resulted in the deaths of 7 students and left
                        41 others seriously injured. The fact that the police chief on the scene, 
                        Reşat Altay, ordered officers who wanted to pursue the attackers to 
                        "stop" revealed the
                        internal state cooperation in the organization of the assault.

                        Evidence proved that the 
                        names behind the massacre were directly linked to the 
                        MHP and the Grey Wolves (Ülkü Ocakları). Years later, 
                        it was revealed that Abdullah Çatlı supplied the bombs and
                        Zülküf İsot was the individual who threw them. The name of police
                        officer Reşat Altay continued to appear in connection with similar 
                        negligence in later dark events, such as the Gazi Massacre and the Hrant 
                        Dink assassination. The limited number of defendants tried in the case
                        were acquitted through lack of evidence or 
                        political interference, fostering a culture of impunity.

                        Despite decades of legal struggle and the emergence of new evidence,
                        the March 16 Massacre case was closed in 2008 during the AKP government’s 
                        term on the grounds of the statute of limitations. This decision was upheld
                        by the Court of Appeals in 2010. This massacre went down in history as one
                        of the bloodiest links in the counter-guerrilla activities designed to
                        drag society into chaos and create the image that the "state had lost
                        control," 
                        thereby preparing the ground for the September 12, 1980, military coup.
