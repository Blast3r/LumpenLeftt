          In order to explain why we say PKK is terroist organization I have to explain how we get to this point. 
          There is 3 key event happened in Turkey around end of 70s. Those are 16 March Massacre 1978, Bloddy May 1977, Kahramanmaraş Massacre
          and in the end 12th September Coup. First I want to start with Ülkücü movement. In Turkish there are 3 different words that can be translated as nationalist in english. These are
          Milliyetçi, Ulusalcı and Ülkücü.

              It is more based on anti-exploitation of a the land I'm living in. Anti-exploitation of land, 
              culture and religion. Independency from imperialist countries.

              is more Atatürk ideology of nationalism, softer and labelling every citizen in Turkey as 
              Turk but not as ethnicity but by the free citizen ideology. It is a debetable topic, in my perspective 
              I get it where it comes from and neccessity of it but those ideas need reformation. Although in Turkey 
              we never get to that point cause every new day in Turkey another problem arises.

              is basically nazism, the high identity of Turks and they do not accept such thing as

              They see non-Turks as a threat to their pure Turkishness. Ironically, they are supported by NATO and USA

          Around the end of 60's there was a huge leftist movement happening in Turkey. Due to previous regime by Adnan Menderes, Turkey was turning into
          a source for USA. In Menderes time, he closed schools in small towns, in order to get more vote from people, he even quotes
          "if we educate them they will not vote for us". He was doing the bidding of USA, cancelling train rails projects, burning opium farms which they were used
          for pharmacy and accepting Marshall pact which this pact led to an inner govermental organization called "Counter-Guerrilla" which was the turkish branch of NATO's stay-behind operation in case of a "soviet invasion".
          In Italy it was called Gladio....

          Adnan Menderes's time ended with 1960 coup but the deep state structure was still there. In 1965, Justice party came to power which was the continuation of Menderes's party.
          In this period, there was a huge leftist movement happening in Turkey, especially in universities.
          The leftist movement was not only in universities but also in working class neighbourhoods. The key event that led to Ülkücü movement and Commando camps was
          1969 6th fleet protests in Istanbul. The protest was against USA's 6th fleet visiting Istanbul, the protest was organised by students and working class people....

          During the protest, a group of students from Istanbul University were marching towards American consulate when they were attacked by a group of people armed with knives and sticks.
          The attack was organised by a group called "Turkish Hearths" which is the predecessor of Ülkücü movement. During the attack, 2 students were killed and many were injured.
          After the attack, leftist movement in Turkey started to gain more momentum, especially in universities. In response to leftist movement, Ülkücü movement started to gain more momentum as well.
          They started to organise themselves in commando camps, where they were trained in guerrilla warfare. The camps were established in various parts of Turkey, especially in 
          Central Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia. The United States funded and supplied weapons to the camps, where the instructors were Turkish irregulars previously trained by the US...

  By the late 60s, the MHP ("Milliyetçi" Movement Party) began executing a National Socialist (Nazi) doctrine, 
  using "Turkish Nationalism" as a mask to dismantle the democratic order. They established
  "Commando Camps"—paramilitary training grounds modeled directly after Hitler’s SS and 
  SA Storm Units—to breed a "striking force" to crush revolutionary movements. Recruits endured 
  a brutal 03:30 AM regime of combat and weapons training designed to prepare them for seizing power 
  and "cleansing" minorities within a racially pure "Turan" empire. 
  During the Maraş Massacre (1978), Ülkücü militants, organized under the 
  "National Socialist" doctrine mentioned in official 1970 reports.
  In cities like Maraş and Çorum, these groups ignited massacres by marking 
  the houses of

  <span class="target-info" data-desc="Students, workers, and intellectuals labeled as 'communists' to be crushed by the striking force.">Leftists</span>, 
  inciting mob violence, and conducting systematic killings that resulted in hundreds of deaths. Their actions were not mere street 
  clashes but were calculated "striking force" operations aimed at creating enough chaos to justify a
  military takeover and the eventual establishment of a racially unified "Turan" empire.
